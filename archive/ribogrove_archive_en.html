<p><sup>*</sup> The two dates are correct: releases 2.208 and 3.209 were released on the same day.</p>
<p><sup>**</sup> You may wonder, why RiboGrove 1.207 was released on December 8<sup>th</sup>, 2021, and RiboGrove 2.208 on November 25<sup>th</sup>, 2021. The reason is that initially (on October 28<sup>th</sup>, 2021), RiboGrove 1.207 wasn&rsquo;t, strictly speaking, based on RefSeq 207 â€” it contained sequences, which had been added to RefSeq after release 207 but before release 208. The corrected version of RiboGrove 1.207 (2021-12-08) is based on RefSeq 207, without &ldquo;contaminations&rdquo; from RefSeq 208.</p>
