<h2 style="margin-top:1.0rem;">Release 8.214 (2022-10-13). Latest release.</h2>
<p>Starting with release 8.214:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    RiboGrove uses new format of fasta headers to improve search specificity. Example:<br>
    Old header:<br><span style="font-family:monospace;font-size:14px">>NZ_CP009686.1:8908-10459_plus Bacillus_cereus ;Bacteria;Firmicutes;Bacilli;Bacillales;Bacillaceae;Bacillus; category:1</span><br>
    New header:<br><span style="font-family:monospace;font-size:14px">>G_324861:NZ_CP009686.1:8908-10459:plus ;d__Bacteria;p__Firmicutes;c__Bacilli;o__Bacillales;f__Bacillaceae;g__Bacillus;s__cereus; category:1</span><br>
    Please, see the <a href="index.html#header-format">8.214 release page</a> for details.
  </li>
  <li>We don&rsquo;t publish fasta file of &ldquo;raw&rdquo; gene sequences any more because its content is mostly the same as data stored in the fasta file of full-length sequences.</li>
  <li>To replace &ldquo;raw&rdquo; fasta file, metadata now contains file <span style="font-family:monospace;">discarded_sequences.fasta.gz</span>. This file contains 16S rRNA gene sequences which were present in source RefSeq genomes and were annotated a 16S rRNA genes but which have been discarded according to their incompleteness, internal repeats etc. and thus haven&rsquo;t been included into RiboGrove.</li>
  <li>Metadata now does not contain files <span style="font-family:monospace;">per_replicon_statistics.tsv</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace;">raw_per_replicon_statistics.tsv</span> because of their unnecessary redundancy. All data they contained can be easily obtained from files <span style="font-family:monospace;">gene_seqs_statistics.tsv</span> and <span style="font-family:monospace;">discarded_gene_seqs_statistics.tsv</span>.</li>

<h2 style="margin-top:.5rem;">Release 7.213 (2022-07-20).</h2>
<p>Starting with release 7.213, metadata contains file <span style="font-family:monospace;">QIIME2-compatible-taxonomy.txt</span>. This is a TSV file, which can be used to train a QIIME2 classifier (see the <a href="https://docs.qiime2.org">tutorial</a>).</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:.5rem;">Release 1.207 (2021-12-08)</h2>
<p>You may wonder, why RiboGrove 1.207 was realeased on December 8<sup>th</sup>, 2021, and RiboGrove 2.208 on November 25<sup>th</sup>, 2021. The reason is that initially (on October 28<sup>th</sup>, 2021), RiboGrove 1.207 wasn’t, strictly speaking, based on RefSeq 207 — it contained sequences, which had been added to RefSeq after release 207 but before release 208. The corrected version of RiboGrove 1.207 (2021-12-08) is based on RefSeq 207, without “contaminations” from RefSeq 208.</p>
